            Toyota has revealed the GR Supra Super GT concept at the Tokyo Auto Salon this week, confirming its entry into its home country's 'Super GT' championship from next year.
            First previewed last month, the Super GT concept is a little different to the Supra Gazoo Racing concept shown at the 2018 Geneva motor show, which looked more like a GT3 race car. In the Super GT championship, the race-ready Supra will duke it out with motorsport versions of flagship Japanese coupes like the Lexus LC500, Nissan GT-R and Honda NSX.
            The company adds in its press release the concept "underscores Toyota's focus on using motorsport to help accelerate development of production models".
            We're only days away from the official reveal of the road-going Supra at the Detroit motor show, too, which kicks off on January 14.
